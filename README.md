## Demo

Electron movement under an electric field is implemented in `Part5.m` in 
[legacy](https://github.com/JonathanALevine/microMonteCarlo/tree/legacy).
Work is ongoing at at tranferring this to [main](https://github.com/JonathanALevine/microMonteCarlo). 
PR's are welcome if you would like to implement this.
