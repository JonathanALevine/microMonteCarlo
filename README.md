# microMonteCarlo

![Monte Carlo simulation with scattering on](scattering_on.gif)
A micro project for playing around with Monte Carlo simulations. 
This project was initially for simulating Electron Transport using Monte Carlo techniques.

Scattering disabled for the electrons

### Example usage

### Features
List down the features of your project here. For example:
- Electron movement under an electric field is implemented in `Part5.m` in 
[legacy](https://github.com/JonathanALevine/microMonteCarlo/tree/legacy).
Work is ongoing at tranferring this to [main](https://github.com/JonathanALevine/microMonteCarlo). 
PR's are welcome if you would like to implement this. 
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
